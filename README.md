## Technical Projects

#### Handcrafty - Sell & Shop for Handmade Items

React & GraphQL Project, _Feb - Apr 2019_

- Built a full-stack Etsy-like web app where user can search, sell, edit, add to cart and buy their favorite items.
- Created a server side rendered frontend with NextJS, and used Apollo-client for fetching/caching data from the GraphQL backend and local state management; Tested the major components using Jest and Enzyme.
- Designed extensive relational data models including users, items, orders, shopping cart items, and order items; Implemented the data layer on the backend using GraphQL Yoga and Prisma.
- Developed server side functionalities including JWT authentication, permissions, email password updates, uploading images, and charging credit cards with StripeJS.

#### 百字本 (100-Letter) Baizi Journal App

Self-Initiated Project, _Jan - Feb 2019_

- Designed and developed a minimalist journal app which prompts user to write a journal with 100 Chinese characters exact every day. I initiated this project based on my journaling habit for the past 10 years, and by developing this app, I aim to share this fun journal format with the world.
- Reached out to a senior developer and collaborated on backend development, built a REST API with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB, featuring JWT authentication and NoSQL schema.
- Independently developed the frontend with React.js and Redux, implemented routing using React Router, and implemented data services using Axios and Redux Thunk.
- Manage deployment to XRCloud in China.

#### Computational Modeling of High Speed Jet Impingement

Research Project, _June - Oct 2018_

- Developed numerical procedures in C using an open source software named Basilisk , to simulate high speed liquid jet impingement on a moving surface, providing physical insight to the phenomena that was not observable through experiments.
- Used supercomputing and MPI parallel algorithm to accelerate the computation, reducing the runtime by 99%.
